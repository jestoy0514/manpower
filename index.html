<h1>Manpower Management 1.0.0</h1>
<p>A simple manpower management software. It is used to track down manpower, print report for submission, and can export to excel too if needed.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I was using excel to track down and submit the report for manpower up until recently. The problem with excel files is that the more sheets you use the slower it become. If you decide to use diffirent excel files it will be difficult to track down old reports and quite difficult to search unlike this software you just need to select the date and the system itself will carry on the searching for you. Hence this software.</p>
<h2>Build Status</h2>
<p>This software is now possible to use but some of the options are still under construction but most of the basic requirements are already met so using it in everyday will be okay. I was thinking of adding a dashboard option just to show how are the status of the manpower divided and been utilized for different projects.</p>
